Hey Noah and Jared-
	Welcome to RPG on GitHub. Here's a basic TODO list (we can keep this updated as we go).

- Levelup Screen
- Implement Money
- Redo inventory to have items that aren't weapons (maybe just add ".inventory" to the player class because ".inv" for weapons is so integrated already)
- Sprites for the battle sequences
- Generally clean up the code in battle() (I'm sure there's a better way to do it then the bajillion loops we have now)
- More enemies (I have some basic stat distributions and stuff for about 10, but you know, doesn't hurt to have more)
- More weapons (Same deal; would be cool to implement some effects [such as magic that raises certain stats]).

Feel free to add on.
